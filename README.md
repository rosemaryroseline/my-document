Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor
The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is an advanced web-based application that allows multiple users to edit and collaborate on a document in real time. Built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database, this editor ensures seamless document synchronization using multiple WebSockets. Developed in Visual Studio, the project is designed to provide a smooth and efficient collaborative experience.

The application is structured around WebSockets, enabling real-time communication between users. When multiple users access the same document using the same URL, they can see and edit changes instantly. WebSockets ensure low-latency updates, meaning every keystroke is reflected in real time for all connected users. However, if users open different URLs, they are editing separate documents, and changes made in one document do not affect others. This ensures that each document remains independent and prevents unintended modifications across multiple sessions.

On the frontend, React provides a dynamic user experience, rendering updates instantly without requiring page reloads. A rich text editor, such as Quill.js or Draft.js, is integrated, allowing users to format text with options like bold, italics, underline, and bullet points. The state management of the editor is handled efficiently using React Context API or Redux, ensuring smooth real-time updates.

The backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, handles WebSocket connections, authentication, and document storage. When a user starts editing a document, the backend identifies whether the document exists in the database. If not, a new entry is created in MongoDB. Each document is assigned a unique URL, ensuring that multiple documents can exist independently.

MongoDB serves as the database, storing documents, user data, and edit history. Changes to a document are stored in real-time, allowing users to retrieve previous versions if needed. To manage concurrent edits and prevent conflicts, techniques such as Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are implemented, ensuring smooth synchronization between users.

An additional feature includes auto-save functionality, which ensures that no changes are lost, even if a user disconnects or the system encounters an issue. This allows users to continue working without worrying about manual saves.

For deployment, the frontend can be hosted on Vercel or Firebase, while the backend can be deployed on Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. The application supports cross-platform accessibility, meaning users can collaborate from desktops, tablets, and mobile devices seamlessly.

By leveraging React, Node.js, MongoDB, and WebSockets, this Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor provides a high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly solution for collaborative writing. The ability to edit the same document in real-time under the same URL while keeping separate documents isolated ensures efficient teamwork without data conflicts.
